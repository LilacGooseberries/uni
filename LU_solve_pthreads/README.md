parallel linear system solver, LU block method
usage: ./solve <n> <m> <p> [matrix.txt] [rhs.txt]
where n is size of system (n x n matrix), m is size of the blocks, p is number of threads,
matrix.txt is coeffs of (n x n) system, rhs.txt is vector (n x 1) right hand side of the system
if txt file is not specified, system is generated by formula: A_ij = n-i-j,
and b_i = sum of every odd element in corresponding row of matrix, so that answer is determined beforehand as vector 101010...
